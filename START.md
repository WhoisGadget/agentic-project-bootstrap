# START.md – How to Begin or Resume

1. Open project in Cursor / Claude Code
2. Ask: "Continue from TASKS.md and HEALTH.md"
3. Or: "Plan task 1 from TASKS.md"

Key Files:
- TASKS.md → what to do next
- HEALTH.md → quick status
- PROGRESS.md → recent work
- FEEDBACK.md → human preferences

Run weekly improvements: Ask "Run retrospective"
