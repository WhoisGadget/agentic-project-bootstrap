# COMPRESSION.md – How to Summarize Efficiently

Guidelines for memory files:

SUMMARY.md → 10–20 high-level bullets max:
- Project goal
- Major architecture/tech decisions
- Key milestones achieved

PROGRESS.md → Current open tasks (≤8), recent completed (dated), blockers:
- [CODE] Implemented X – 2026-01-06
- [TEST] Added coverage for Y – passing
- [RES] Confirmed Z via source – high confidence
- [BLOCK] Awaiting clarification on requirement

RESEARCH_NOTES.md → One concise entry per major finding:
- Topic/Hypothesis: One-sentence summary
- Evidence: 1–2 key points + sources
- Confidence: High/Medium/Low
- Implications/Next

Use short tags: [PLAN] [CODE] [TEST] [RES] [DEC] [BLOCK]
